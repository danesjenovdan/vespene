*******************
Partnership Program
*******************

Michael DeHaan LLC does not create proprietary software, plugins, or paid enterprise versions of Vespene. We do not offer hosting,
services, or consulting. We don't do paid events. We simply develop open software for everyone and help oversee the Vespene community.

Organizations wishing to sell Vespene are required to join the Vespene Partner Program (VPP). Our definition of "sell" 
includes providing consulting, support services, or hosting for a fee. It also includes making for-pay extensions to Vespene, such as proprietary
plugins, or including Vespene in a product or solution that is made available to paying customers. 

In addition to supporting development, this program also allows us to stay connected with those partners.

The VPP is meant to be affordable. Because we know that small consultancies are amazing users and community members, 
membership in the VPP will be offered free of charge to small consultancies who request it. For larger organizations, discounts may be offered for a strong 
history of contribution and participation. 

We also want to underscore that use of the Vespene software at a place of business isn't selling Vespene, and isn't restricted under our license in any way.
